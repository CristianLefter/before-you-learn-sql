## 9.1 What is SQL?

### Definition and Purpose

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a specialized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Declarative Language**: You specify what data you want, not how to get it
- **Set-Based Processing**: Operates on sets of data rather than individual records
- **Standardized**: Based on industry standards (though with vendor variations)
- **Embedded**: Often used within other programming languages
- **Dual Nature**: Both a data definition and data manipulation language

#### Primary Purposes:

- **Data Definition**: Creating and modifying database structures
- **Data Manipulation**: Inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting data
- **Data Control**: Managing access permissions
- **Transaction Control**: Ensuring data integrity during operations

#### Why SQL Matters:

- **Universal Database Language**: Used by virtually all relational database systems
- **Powerful Data Access**: Efficiently retrieve and manipulate large datasets
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted across industries and applications
- **Career Essential**: Required skill for many IT and data-related roles

#### Why This Matters for Learning Transact-SQL:
Understanding the fundamental purpose and characteristics of SQL provides context for learning Transact-SQL specifically. Transact-SQL builds upon standard SQL with additional features and capabilities.

### SQL vs. Transact-SQL

Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's implementation of SQL used in SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, with extensions beyond standard SQL.

#### Key Differences:

| Feature | Standard SQL | Transact-SQL |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Scope** | Core language features | Extended programming capabilities |
| **Procedural Elements** | Limited | Extensive (variables, flow control, etc.) |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Advanced (TRY/CATCH) |
| **Functions** | Standard set | Additional proprietary functions |
| **Extensions** | None | Common Table Expressions, Window Functions (earlier than standard SQL) |
| **Portability** | High | Limited to Microsoft products |

#### Transact-SQL Enhancements:

- **Programming Constructs**: Variables, IF/ELSE, WHILE loops
- **Error Handling**: TRY/CATCH blocks

- **Table Variables**: Temporary tables stored in memory
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: For recursive queries and improved readability
- **Window Functions**: For advanced analytical queries
- **TOP and OFFSET/FETCH**: For result limiting and paging
- **MERGE Statement**: For combined insert/update/delete operations

#### Example Comparison:

**Standard SQL:**
```sql
-- Simple query with standard SQL
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Transact-SQL:**
```sql
-- T-SQL procedural code
DECLARE @variable INT = 10;

IF @variable > 5
BEGIN
    SELECT TOP (@variable) column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE different_condition;
END
```

#### Why This Matters for Learning Transact-SQL:
Understanding the differences between standard SQL and Transact-SQL helps you distinguish between portable SQL concepts and Microsoft-specific features. This knowledge is important for writing code that can be migrated between different database systems if needed.

## 9.2 SQL Language Categories

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

Data Definition Language (DDL) consists of SQL commands used to define, modify, and remove database objects.

#### Primary DDL Commands:

- **CREATE**: Creates new database objects
- **ALTER**: Modifies existing database objects
- **DROP**: Removes database objects
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records from a table, but keeps the structure
- **COMMENT**: Adds comments to the data dictionary
- **RENAME**: Renames database objects

#### Common Database Objects Managed with DDL:

- **Databases**: The overall container for data
- **Tables**: Structures that store data in rows and columns

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    RegistrationDate DATE DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Add a column to an existing table
ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD PhoneNumber VARCHAR(20);

-- Remove a table
DROP TABLE Customers;

-- Remove all data from a table but keep the structure
TRUNCATE TABLE OrderHistory;
```

#### Why This Matters for Learning Transact-SQL:
DDL commands form the foundation for creating and managing database structures. Understanding these commands is essential for setting up the environment in which your data will be stored and accessed.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Data Manipulation Language (DML) consists of SQL commands used to manipulate the data stored in database objects.

#### Primary DML Commands:

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more tables
- **INSERT**: Adds new records to a table
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records
- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table
- **MERGE**: Combines INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations (in some SQL implementations)
- **CALL**: Executes a stored procedure (in some SQL implementations)

#### Key DML Concepts:

- **Queries**: Statements that retrieve data (primarily SELECT)
- **Subqueries**: Queries nested within other queries
- **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing data with functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT
- **Filtering**: Limiting results with WHERE clauses
- **Sorting**: Ordering results with ORDER BY
- **Grouping**: Organizing results with GROUP BY

#### Example DML Statements:

```sql
-- Retrieve data
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email
FROM Customers
WHERE State = 'CA'
ORDER BY LastName;

-- Insert new data
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email)
VALUES (1001, 'John', 'Smith', 'john.smith@example.com');

-- Update existing data
UPDATE Customers
SET PhoneNumber = '555-123-4567'
WHERE CustomerID = 1001;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID = 1001;

-- Merge operation (SQL Server)
MERGE INTO Customers AS target
USING ImportedCustomers AS source
ON target.CustomerID = source.CustomerID
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET target.PhoneNumber = source.PhoneNumber
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email)
    VALUES (source.CustomerID, source.FirstName, source.LastName, source.Email);
```

#### Why This Matters for Learning Transact-SQL:
DML commands are the most frequently used SQL statements in day-to-day database work. Mastering these commands is essential for effectively working with the data in your database.

### Data Control Language (DCL)

Data Control Language (DCL) consists of SQL commands used to control access to data within the database.

#### Primary DCL Commands:

- **GRANT**: Gives specific privileges to users

#### Types of Privileges:

- **SELECT**: Ability to retrieve data
- **INSERT**: Ability to add new records
- **UPDATE**: Ability to modify existing records
- **DELETE**: Ability to remove records
- **EXECUTE**: Ability to run stored procedures
- **REFERENCES**: Ability to create foreign keys
- **ALL PRIVILEGES**: All available privileges

#### Security Concepts:

- **Users**: Individual database accounts
- **Roles**: Groups of privileges that can be assigned to users
- **Schemas**: Containers for database objects that can be used for access control
- **Object-Level Security**: Permissions on specific tables, views, procedures, etc.
- **Column-Level Security**: Permissions on specific columns within tables

#### Example DCL Statements:

```sql
-- Grant SELECT privilege on a table to a user
GRANT SELECT ON Customers TO UserJohn;

-- Grant multiple privileges
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON Orders TO SalesRole;

-- Grant all privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SalesDB TO DBARole;

-- Revoke privileges
REVOKE DELETE ON Customers FROM UserJohn;

-- Deny privilege (SQL Server)
DENY UPDATE ON Customers TO UserJohn;
```

#### Why This Matters for Learning Transact-SQL:
DCL commands are crucial for database security. Understanding these commands helps you implement proper access controls and protect sensitive data in production environments.

### Transaction Control Language (TCL)

Transaction Control Language (TCL) consists of SQL commands used to manage transactions within the database.

#### Primary TCL Commands:

- **BEGIN TRANSACTION**: Marks the start of a transaction
- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the transaction
- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes all changes made during the transaction
- **SAVEPOINT**: Creates points within a transaction to which you can roll back
- **SET TRANSACTION**: Specifies transaction characteristics

#### Transaction Properties (ACID):

- **Atomicity**: All operations complete successfully or none do
- **Consistency**: The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction
- **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other until they're completed
- **Durability**: Once committed, changes are permanent

#### Transaction Isolation Levels:

- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads

#### Example TCL Statements:

```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Perform operations
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1001;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 1002;

-- Check if both operations succeeded
IF @@ERROR = 0
    COMMIT TRANSACTION;
ELSE
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;

-- Using savepoints
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - 10 WHERE ProductID = 101;
SAVE TRANSACTION InventoryUpdated;

UPDATE Orders SET Status = 'Shipped' WHERE OrderID = 5001;
-- If something goes wrong with the order update
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION InventoryUpdated;
-- This rolls back to the savepoint, preserving the inventory update

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

#### Why This Matters for Learning Transact-SQL:
Transaction control is essential for maintaining data integrity, especially in multi-user environments. Understanding TCL commands helps you ensure that your database operations are reliable and consistent.

## 9.3 SQL Standards and Dialects

- **@@IDENTITY and SCOPE_IDENTITY()**: For retrieving identity values

#### Comparison Example:

**Limiting Results:**
```sql
-- T-SQL (SQL Server)
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Customers ORDER BY CustomerID;

-- Oracle
SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY CustomerID FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;

-- MySQL
SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY CustomerID LIMIT 10;

-- Standard SQL (SQL:2008 and later)
SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY CustomerID FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

#### Why This Matters for Learning Transact-SQL:
Being aware of vendor-specific extensions helps you understand which features are unique to Transact-SQL and which are part of standard SQL. This awareness is important for code portability and for understanding SQL documentation from different sources.

-- Get order count for a specific customer
SELECT 
    @CustomerName = FirstName + ' ' + LastName,
    @OrderCount = COUNT(O.OrderID)
FROM 
    Customers C
    LEFT JOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID
WHERE 
    C.CustomerID = 1001
GROUP BY 
    FirstName, LastName;

-- Use the variables in conditional logic
IF @OrderCount > 10
BEGIN
    PRINT @CustomerName + ' is a VIP customer with ' + CAST(@OrderCount AS NVARCHAR) + ' orders.';
    
    -- Update customer status
    UPDATE Customers
    SET Status = 'VIP'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1001;
END
