#### Example: Reading a Simple Execution Plan

For a query like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE State = 'CA';
```

The execution plan might show:
1. An index seek operation if there's an index on the State column
2. Or a table scan if there's no suitable index
3. The relative cost of the operation
4. The number of rows expected to be returned

#### Why This Matters for SQL:
Understanding execution plans helps you write more efficient queries. As databases grow, query performance becomes increasingly important, and execution plans are your primary tool for identifying and resolving performance issues.
